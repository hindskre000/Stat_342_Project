b. **Abstract**: The abstract provides a brief summary of the entire paper (background, methods, results and conclusions). The suggested length is no more than 150 words. This allows you approximately 1 sentence (and likely no more than two sentences) summarizing each of the following sections. Typically, abstracts are the last thing you write.

  *Assessment: Are the main points of the paper clearly and succinctly described?*
     
c. **Keywords**:
* Maximum Likelihood Estimation: Using the likelihood function of a parameter, the maximum likelihood estimation approach for estimating a parameter finds the maximum of the function after a log transformation by using it's first and second derivative. After finding the maximum of the function we can solve for the estimated parameter $^{6.1}$.
* Method of Moments Estimation: With the assumption that the expected value of a random variable will be a function of a parameter and the sample average will be close to the expected value, methods of moments estimation sets the sample average equal to the expected value and solves for the estimated parameter $^{6.2}$.
* Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use Authorization (EUA): A mechanism of the FDA to enable the usage of medical countermeasures during public health emergencies. This may include allowing use of unapproved medical products or allowing the usage of already approved medical products for an unapproved purpose $^5$. 
* Coronavirus (COVID 19): A contagious infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, first originating in Wuhan, China December 2019 $^1$.
* Pfizer Vaccine (BNT162b2):A two-dose vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, safe for all individuals 6 months and above $^3$.

d. **Introduction**: With a total of 775 million cases and 7 million deaths reported from January 2020-May 2024 $^4$, Coronavirus has affected people around the globe and continues to be an ongoing concern. After being declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020 $^1$ emergency use authorizations were issued to combat the virus. In December 2020, Pfizer and BioNTech successfully obtained a US FDA Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to begin distributing their vaccine (BNT162b2) for COVID 19 $^{6.3}$.

Using data as reported by Polack et al. $^2$ specifically the relevant data from Table 2 of the paper referenced above (summarized below):
\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\caption{Vaccine Efficacy against Covid 19 at least 7 days after second dose in patients without evidence of infection}
\begin{tabular}{cccc}
Group & Covid-19 Cases & No. of subjects\\ \hline
BNT162b2 & 8 & 17,411 \\
Placebo & 162 & 17,511 \\ \hline
Total & 170 & 34,922 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table} 

We will use maximum likelihood estimation and method of moments estimation to report the estimated efficacy rate of the Pfizer vaccine. Using these estimates we will preform hypothesis testing to determine if the efficacy rate meets the FDA EUA requirements of at least 30% $^{6.4}$.
   
e. **Statistical Methods**: begin with defining the random variable and your statistical model, define the parameter of interest and then describe at least two different approaches you will use to make inference about it. 

    You should have (at least) two subsections, one for each method, which contain formulas and details of calculations related to that method. The results for the data at hand will only be shown in the next section.



  *Assessment:*
  
  - *Could the analyses be repeated based on the information given here?*
  
  - *Is fluency of concepts demonstrated?*
  
  - *Is the material organized into logical categories.*
    
   
f. **Results**: Typically, results sections start with descriptive statistics, e.g. what percent of the sample is male/female, what is the mean GPA overall, in the different groups, etc. Figures can be nice to illustrate these differences! However, information presented must be relevant in helping to answer the research question(s) of interest. Typically, inferential (i.e., confidence intervals, significance tests) statistics come next. Do not give raw computer output here! This should look like a peer-reviewed journal article results section. Tables and figures should be labeled, embedded in the text, and referenced appropriately. The results section typically makes for fairly dry reading. It does not explain the impact of findings, it merely highlights and reports statistical information. 

  *Assessment*
  
  - *Is the content appropriate for a results section? Is there a clear description of the results?*
  
  - *Are the results/data analyzed well? Given the data in each figure/table is the interpretation accurate and logical? Is the analysis of the data thorough (anything ignored?)* 

  - *Are the figures/tables appropriate for the data being discussed? Are the figure legends and titles clear and concise?*



g. **Discussion/Conclusion**: discuss your findings in practical terms, compare and contrast the results with each other and with the Pfizer analysis, identify strengths and weaknesses of the methods used. 


   *Assessment:*
   
   - *Do the authors clearly state whether the results answer the question (support or disprove the hypothesis)?*
   
   - *Were specific data cited from the results to support each interpretation? Do the authors clearly articulate the basis for supporting or rejecting each hypothesis?*
   
   
Reference the papers results?

In the paper, the authors used a Bayesian beta binomial model with the transformation 
$$\pi = \frac{\pi_v}{\pi_v+\pi_p}$$
where $\pi_v$ and $\pi_p$ are the probabilities of an infection in the vaccine and placebo groups respectively. 


They estimated the vaccine efficacy $\psi = \frac{1-2 \pi}{1-\pi}$ to be 95\%. The 95\% Bayesian credible interval for $\psi$  was $[90.3\%, 97.6\%]$, and they reported that the Bayesian estimate for the probability that vaccine efficacy exceeded 30\% was larger than 0.9999. 
   
  
h.  **References**: List at least three references for your paper. These can be other articles on the subject/data, or mathematical references for the statistical techniques that you used. Each item you list here should be cited/referenced at least once in the actual text. For example, [here](https://errorstatistics.com/2021/01/17/s-senn-beta-testing-the-pfizer-biontech-statistical-analysis-of-their-covid-19-vaccine-trial-guest-post/) is a blog by Stephen Senn that really helped me understand the problem. He's a great writer and you could read his other blogs on the vaccine trials.

   - *Are the references appropriate and of adequate quality?* 
   
   - *Are the references cited properly (both in the text and at the end of the paper)?*
   
   
h. **Appendix**: Include important R code, R output and additional plots/figures. Any plots you include in your report should be cited in the body of the report. There should be a reason for the plot â€“ something you want the reader to see. Note: tables and figures which are pertinent to your analysis should be included in the body of your report, not in the appendix. The reader should not have to look at your appendix for main results/figures. 
    
    For example, you can write your code in chunks interspersed within the document, with chunk option `include = FALSE`. Then refer to the code chunk in the Appendix to print it.
